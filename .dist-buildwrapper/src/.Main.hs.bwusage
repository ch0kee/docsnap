It supports\n easily switching between interpreting source and running statically compiled\n code.\n\n In either mode, the generated program should be run from the root of the\n project tree. When it is run, it locates its templates, static content, and\n source files in development mode, relative to the current working directory.\n\n When compiled with the development flag, only changes to the libraries, your\n cabal file, or this file should require a recompile to be picked up.\n Everything else is interpreted at runtime. There are a few consequences of\n this.\n\n First, this is much slower. Running the interpreter takes a significant\n chunk of time (a couple tenths of a second on the author's machine, at this\n time), regardless of the simplicity of the loaded code. In order to\n recompile and re-load server state as infrequently as possible, the source\n directories are watched for updates, as are any extra directories specified\n below.\n\n Second, the generated server binary is MUCH larger, since it links in the\n GHC API (via the hint library).\n\n Third, and the reason you would ever want to actually compile with\n development mode, is that it enables a faster development cycle. You can\n simply edit a file, save your changes, and hit reload to see your changes\n reflected immediately.\n\n When this is compiled without the development flag, all the actions are\n statically compiled in. This results in faster execution, a smaller binary\n size, and having to recompile the server for any code change.\n","n":"main","s":"IO ()","c":[],"l":[68,1,93,0]},{"t":["Function"],"d":"This action loads the config used by this application.
